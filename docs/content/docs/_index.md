## Expressions
Srotas uses [Expr](https://expr-lang.org/) for dynamic evaluations in YAML configurations and CLI expressions.  
Expr provides a powerful yet simple syntax for defining expressions.  

To learn more about the syntax and capabilities of Expr, refer to the official documentation:  
[Expr Language Definition](https://expr-lang.org/docs/language-definition)
